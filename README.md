this project involves creating a well structured HTML5 webpage, which starts by organizing files in a folder named lab2-html.with a file called index.html as a main file and a README.md for the project description.
the web page uses semantic HTML elements which ensure clarity and accessibility. it also has a sidebar adding more resources.
a contact form is added below the footer, allowing users to submit names, email and a message. the form includes HTML5 validation ensuring correctness.
The HTML code is validated through the W3C Validator, where errors or warnings are fixed to maintain compliance with web standards.
Finally, the project is pushed to a GitHub repository named lab2-html using Git commands, enabling version control and public accessibility. This process ensures the webpage is well-structured, validated, and properly documented for submission.
