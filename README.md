The project involves creating a well-structured HTML5 webpage.
It starts by organizing files in a folder with a name lab2-html, with index.html as the main file and README.md for the project description.
The webpage uses semantic HTML elements, including <header>, <nav>, <main>, <section>, <article>, <aside>, and <footer>, to ensure clarity and accessibility.
The navigation menu links to different sections, and a sidebar provides additional resources.
A contact form is added below the footer, allows users to submit their name, email, and a message.
the form includes some HTML5 validation to ensure input correctness, such as required fields and character length restrictions.
the HTML code is validated through the W3C Validator, where errors or warnings are fixed to maintain compliance with web standards.
lastly, the project is pushed to a GitHub repository named lab2-html using Git commands, enabling version control and public accessibility.
